Port of [[https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery][vim-srcery]], a colorscheme that focus on ease of use and clearly defined
contrasting colors with a slightly earthy tone.

** Requirements
   Emacs 24 or above
*** GUI
   Should work out of the box. I recommend [[https://github.com/tarsius/paren-face][paren-face]] and
   [[https://github.com/tsdh/highlight-parentheses.el][highlight-parentheses.el]] if you enjoy lisp at all.
*** Terminal

    To use Srcery in the terminal you need to change your terminal emulator’s
    so-called “ASCII” colors to the ones in the table below.

    | TERMCOL        | NR | HEX     | RGB           |
    |----------------+----+---------+---------------|
    | black          |  0 | #1C1B19 | 28,  27,  25  |
    | red            |  1 | #EF2F27 | 239, 47, 39   |
    | green          |  2 | #519F50 | 81,  159, 80  |
    | yellow         |  3 | #FBB829 | 251, 184, 41  |
    | blue           |  4 | #2C78BF | 44, 120, 191  |
    | magenta        |  5 | #E02C6D | 224, 44,  109 |
    | cyan           |  6 | #0AAEB3 | 10, 174, 179  |
    | white          |  7 | #918175 | 145, 129, 117 |
    |----------------+----+---------+---------------|
    | bright-black   |  8 | #2D2C29 | 45, 44, 41    |
    | brright-red    |  9 | #F75341 | 247, 83, 65   |
    | bright-green   | 10 | #98BC37 | 152, 188, 55  |
    | bright-yellow  | 11 | #FED06E | 254, 208, 110 |
    | bright-blue    | 12 | #68A8E4 | 104, 168, 228 |
    | bright-magenta | 13 | #FF5C8F | 255, 92, 143  |
    | bright-cyan    | 14 | #53FDE9 | 83, 253, 233  |
    | bright-White   | 15 | #FCE8C3 | 252, 232, 195 |

    See [[https://github.com/roosta/vim-srcery/tree/master/term_colors][vim-srcery/term_colors]] for a list of terminal configs.

    In addition to the table above Srcery uses a few unmodified xterm colors.
    Since most terminals have these defined it pads out the color selection
    nicely without over complicating things.

    Make sure your ~$TERM~ supports 256 colors.

** Customization
   Srcery has a couple of options that can be tweaked via ~M-x customize~:
*** srcery-theme-org-height
    This toggles the use of varying org headings heights.
*** srcery-theme-custom-colors
    A list of colors to override. Srcery only has the 16 colors defined and
    overriding them won't have any effect in the terminal but if you'd like to
    change any of the colors this is how:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (custom-set-variables '(srcery-theme-custom-colors
                              '((black . "#121212")
                                (green . "#00AFAF"))))
    #+END_SRC
*** srcery-theme-invert-matches
    This toggles whether to inverse-video search matches. It defaults to nil.

    Reasoning behind this is that if search results are inverted, the color
    information is preserved. Downside is that it sometimes makes navigation a
    bit tricky, when the cursor color matches the search match. Inverting cursor
    is an option here and the theme tries to set it to inverse when this
    variable is true.

** Supported modes
   - company
   - ein
   - erc
   - gnus
   - helm
   - ido
   - info
   - magit
   - mu4e
   - neotree
   - org
   - evil-snipe
   - paren-face
   - cider
   - dired
   - flycheck
   - git-gutter
   - ivy
   - latex
   - powerline
   - spaceline
   - and others, more coming

    Modes are still a work in progress.
** Attribution
   I'm new to elisp, so I used the [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][spacemacs-theme]] as a base for emacs-srcery.
   Huge thanks to everyone involved with that theme, and [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] itself.
